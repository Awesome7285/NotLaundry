  description: "Ports, indicators, batteries \u2013 yes, by now we probably all know
    and admit that edgework is important. Sometimes the number of strikes or the number
    of modules is too. But how about the modules themselves? How could we have forgotten
    them, especially considering they're what we\u2019re trying to defuse? \r\n\r\nModules
    Against Humanity, inspired by a popular board game (no idea which one, right?),
    addresses this exact problem \u2013 the main heroes of this module are the other
    modules that you may or may not have on the bomb. Can you understand which ones
    you\u2019re meant to look for though? \r\n\r\nThis module was dreamed up by the
    lovely Catnip, like always, I'm the codemonkey :) \r\n\r\nThe module id for missions
    is: ModuleAgainstHumanity"
