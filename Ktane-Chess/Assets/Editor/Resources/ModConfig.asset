  description: "Chess, a wonderful pastime for many of us. Someone however decided
    to add it to a bomb... \r\n\r\nFind the one space no piece can touch, only then
    shall this module be disarmed. \r\n\r\nThere is a pdf included in the mod for
    auto generation, however if you're one of the people who like to use singular
    manuals, one can be found here:\r\nktane.timwi.de/HTML/Chess.html\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, all manuals can be viewed online at ktane.timwi.de\r\n\r\nThanks again
    to MoMo for the idea for this mod, and creating the manual in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\nModuleId:
    ChessModule"
