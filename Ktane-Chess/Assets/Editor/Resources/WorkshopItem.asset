  Title: Chess Mod
  Description: "Chess, a wonderful pastime for many of us. Someone however decided
    to add it to a bomb... \r\n\r\nFind the one space no piece can touch, only then
    shall this module be disarmed. \r\n\r\nThere is a pdf included in the mod for
    auto generation, however if you're one of the people who like to use singular
    manuals, one can be found here:\r\nktane.timwi.de/HTML/Chess.html\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, all manuals can be viewed online at ktane.timwi.de\r\n\r\nIf there
    are any issues on any of my mods, feel free to contact me on Discord as Flamanis#7150\r\n\r\nAll
    the code and assets for this module are fully open source, to the point where
    you could actually just compile this mod yourself, and can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/Flamanis/Ktane-Mods/tree/master/Ktane-Chess\r\n\r\nThanks
    again to MoMo for the idea for this mod, and creating the manual in the first
    place.\r\n\r\n\r\nModuleId: ChessModule"
