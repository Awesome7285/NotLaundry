					<h2>On the Subject of Chess</h2>
					<p class="flavour-text">Under pressure, chess can feel more like a game of battleships.</p>
					This module is based on a <b>6x6 chessboard</b> <i>(referenced on the following page)</i> and all figures follow the standard FIDE movement rules.
					<br>
					The chess module will present with a display and two rows of six buttons each.
					<ul>
						<li>There are six unique coordinates that represent six positions on the chessboard.</li>
						<li>Use the numbered keys in the bottom row to browse through the different coordinates. A green LED below the button will indicate the position of the currently selected coordinate.</li>
						<li>Using the reference table below, each position can be assigned a certain chess figure.</li>
						<li>The chess figures will cover 35 of the 36 possible fields with their combined movesets.</li>
						<li>All chess figures are colorless but can block each other's movement.</li>
						<li>Find the one field that isn't covered by any of the chess figures and enter the coordinate to defuse the module.</li>
						<li>To enter the coordinate, press the letter first, then the number. The LEDs will turn red to confirm the input of a solution.</li>
					</ul>
					Use this table as reference to determine the correct figure for each position:
					<br>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<b><u>Position #1: Monarchy vs Theocracy</u></b>
								<br>
								Occupied by a king if Position #5 is occupied by a queen.
								<br>

							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<b><u>Position #2: Commander of the Army</u></b>
								<br>

						</tr>
						<tr>
