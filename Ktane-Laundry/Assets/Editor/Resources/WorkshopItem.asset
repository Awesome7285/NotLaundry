  Title: Laundry
  Description: "Sorting and folding are the least of your worries \r\n\r\nThis is
    a reupload of Laundry, so that I can fix for any breaking changes. \r\nHendruid
    and AcryllicStain are still the brains of the operation, I'm just the codemonkey
    :) \r\n\r\nIt has been brought to my attention that removing a mod from the workshop
    does not delete the files for people (That's sorta dumb). So for those of you
    who were subscribed to the old Laundry you need to manually delete the folder
    for it: Normal file path is \"Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/341800\" Inside
    there delete the folder with the name \"755645519\" as that's the folder that
    contains Laundry's old code. \r\n\r\nAll of the code for the module is on Github
    here: https://github.com/Flamanis/Ktane-Mods/tree/master/Ktane-Laundry \r\n\r\nManual
    Page \r\nThe manual PDFs are included in the download. However, you can also go
    to the following link to view the manual: \r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ityvpvc1cg6pyaw/OnTheSubjectofLaundry.pdf?dl=0
    \r\n\r\n\r\nMission Makers \r\nFor those making custom missions and wanting to
    reference this module, the type name is Laundry."
