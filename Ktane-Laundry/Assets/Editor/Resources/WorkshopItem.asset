  Title: Laundry
  Description: "Sorting and folding are the least of your worries\r\n\r\nAbout \r\nThis
    is my very first module, inspired on the washing instructions symbols. I was able
    to make this because of a lot of help from the KTANE community. Special thanks
    to AcrylicPaint and Flamanis.\r\n\r\nManual Page \r\nThe manual PDFs are included
    in the download. However, you can also go to the following link to view the manual:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ityvpvc1cg6pyaw/OnTheSubjectofLaundry.pdf?dl=0
    \r\n\r\n\r\nMission Makers \r\nFor those making custom missions and wanting to
    reference this module, the type name is Laundry.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModuleId: ChessModule"
